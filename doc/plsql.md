# PL/SQL

## 12c Release 1

### Overview of PL/SQL

#### Main Features of PL/SQL

PL/SQL combines the data-manipulating power of SQL with the processing power of procedural languages.

When you can solve a problem with SQL, you can issue SQL statements from your PL/SQL program, without learning new APIs.

Like other procedural programming languages, PL/SQL lets you declare constants and variables, control program flow, define subprograms, and trap runtime errors.

You can break complex problems into easily understandable subprograms, which you can reuse in multiple applications.
