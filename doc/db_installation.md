# Database Installation

## 11g Release 2

### Oracle Grid Infrastructure for a Standalone Server

The Oracle Grid Infrastructure for a standalone server is the Oracle software that provides system support for an Oracle database including volume management, file system, and automatic restart capabilities.
If you plan to use Oracle Restart or Oracle Automatic Storage Management (Oracle ASM), then you must install Oracle Grid Infrastructure before you install and create the database.
Oracle Grid Infrastructure for a standalone server is the software that includes Oracle Restart and Oracle ASM.
Oracle combines the two infrastructure products into a single set of binaries that is installed as the Oracle Grid Infrastructure home.
