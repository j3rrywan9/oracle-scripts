### Introducing Oracle Net Services

#### About Oracle Net Services

Oracle Net Services provides enterprise-wide connectivity solutions in distributed, heterogeneous computing environments.
Oracle Net Services eases the complexities of network configuration and management, maximizes performance, and improves network diagnostic capabilities.

##### Understanding Connectivity

Oracle Net, a component of Oracle Net Services, enables a network session from a client application to an Oracle Database server.
When a network session is established, Oracle Net acts as the data courier for both the client application and the database.
It is responsible for establishing and maintaining the connection between the client application and database, as well as exchanging messages between them.
Oracle Net is able to perform these jobs because it is located on each computer in the network.

##### Understanding Manageability

Oracle Net Services offers several manageability features to configure and manage networking components.
